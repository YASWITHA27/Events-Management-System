# Unifiesta_Event_Management_System
 Built a secure Event Management System with authentication, authorization, session management, RSVP functionality, and XSS protection. Conducted testing for data integrity and reliability. Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS.


UniFiesta was designed to provide a secure, efficient event management platform tailored for university communities, focusing on user privacy, data security, and ease of use. My primary role involved full-stack development, including backend architecture, database management, and security integration. It focused on building a robust backend, managing the database, and implementing key security features, while also contributing to the frontend and deployment.
The frontend was built with EJS templates, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive, visually engaging interface. EJS enabled dynamic rendering of event listings, profiles, and notifications across devices. Designed with Human-Centric Design principles, the interface makes event creation, RSVPs, and notifications intuitive and accessible. Bootstrap and custom CSS enhanced the styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
The backend, built with Node.js and Express, manages user authentication, event handling, and data processing. Express enabled efficient routing and secure middleware for access control and streamlined API endpoints. Bcrypt was used for password hashing, with session management for secure authentication. Each API endpoint was rigorously tested to ensure efficient request handling and data integrity for key features like event creation and RSVPs.
MongoDB with Mongoose ODM was used to structure and validate data, enabling scalable management of users, events, and RSVPs. Mongoose ensured data integrity and consistency. Cloud-hosted MongoDB provided reliable access, supporting UniFiestaâ€™s growing user base. Express middleware integrated the frontend, backend, and database, while EJS enabled dynamic rendering of events and profiles.
UniFiesta also follows Information Security principles like data sanitization and role-based permissions to protect against XSS and SQL Injection. Its architecture ensures scalability, high availability, and secure integration across backend APIs and frontend. Deployed on a cloud server, it efficiently handles traffic spikes. Developed using Visual Studio Code, Postman, and Chrome DevTools, the project highlights my ability to design and implement secure, scalable software systems focused on data privacy and usability.
